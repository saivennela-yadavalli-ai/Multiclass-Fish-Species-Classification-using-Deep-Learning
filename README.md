# Multiclass-Fish-Species-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on building a Deep Learning-based image classification system that identifies different fish species from images. The classification is performed using both a Custom CNN model and a Transfer Learning InceptionV3 model. The final model is deployed using a Streamlit web application.
